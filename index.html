                <strong>Backstory</strong><br><br>
                <p>After the Slyce Demo app was delivered (See the Slyce Demo project below) and the glowing feedback was coming in, we decided to spin Stylefind off into its own company.</p>
                <p>We felt that we had an opportunity to create a more engaging experience for a more public consumer audience based on the positive feedback we were receiving. And, with that, I started my research to learn more about the market and the problem we would be trying to solve.</p>

              <div id="prj11_s3_info" class="slide_info">
                <strong>Research</strong><br><br>
                <p>After some market research to determine who I should be talking to, I conducted customer development interviews with 12 qualified candidates - hoping to learn more about the fashion discovery and mobile shopping problems they faced.</p>
                <p>There were a few common themes: results should come from retailers with exceptional shipping and return policies only, people want to be notified if something they want goes on sale, and being able to search for items with an image would be extremely helpful.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="prj11_s4_info" class="slide_info">
                <strong>Behind the Scenes</strong><br><br>
                <p>Once I had a list of features for an MVP, I began by sketching and then wireframing the required views for the app.</p>
                <p>I tried to adhere to a few principles: allow people to see value before signing up, only ask for info that's absolutely required to continue through the app, and don't make people enter the same info more than once.</p>
                <p>After getting feedback on the wires, I created mockups and a few of the key animations in Framer.js before soliciting another round of feedback.</p>

                <strong>Measuring</strong><br><br>
                <p>We're still in development, but there are a number of metrics we'll want to be paying attention to when we launch, from both a UX perspective and a business perspective. On the UX side, I'll be using the <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36299.pdf" title="Measuring the User Experience on a Large Scale: User-Centered Metrics for Web Applications">HEART framework</a> to measure the quality of our UX. Specifically I'll be paying attention to Retention and Engagment (i.e. # of images submitted per user per month).</p>

                <strong>Problem</strong><br><br>
                <p>I was contracted by <a href="http://slyce.it" target="_blank" title="Open slyce.it in a new tab/window">Slyce Inc.</a> to design and build a consumer app for iOS that leveraged their visual search technology.</p>
                <p>The goal was to create an app that would showcase this technology in a very favorable light. Using the provided APIs, we needed to enable people to get purchaseable results from the images they submitted. Ultimately, the app would be used by Slyce to demonstrate to retailers and investors the power and accuracy of their visual search magic.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="prj10_s3_info" class="slide_info">
                <strong>Research & Hypothesis</strong><br><br>
                <p>After talking with the stakeholders at Slyce, it was apparent that speed and accuracy were critical to the app's success. In order to showcase the powerful technology Slyce offers, we needed to enable people to easily submit an image and get purchasable results back quickly, in a simple and frictionless way. I knew that perceived speed would need to be a focal point during the design and development of the app. Starting image uploads as early as possible and other sleight of hand like tricks would go a long way in making the app feel faster.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="prj10_s4_info" class="slide_info">
                <strong>Behind the Scenes</strong><br><br>
                <p>I began by wireframing the required views for the app to outline the user's flow through the app. During this process it became clear that enabling people to filter results, or select a category before uploading their image, didn't address the goal of the project. While these features seemed to offer a better overall experience, neither helped to showcase the speed or accuracy of the results Slyce could produce.</p>

              <div id="prj10_s5_info" class="slide_info">
                <strong>Solution</strong><br><br>
                <p>After a few iterations to tweak how we displayed feedback to the user when their image was uploading, how the results were displayed and how soon the user would be sent to the checkout web view (i.e. removing the result info view), we arrived at our finished product - the Stylefind prototype, so to speak.</p>
                <p>The final app was such a hit with Slyce that we decided to spin it off into is own company to create a full consumer app experience that harnesses the power of Slyce.</p>

                <p>This app came to fruition in a slightly irregular way. For our first Hackathon at Wave I wanted to create an app that enabled users to accept a credit card (or cash) payment and then have the payment seamlessly flow into Wave's cloud accounting app.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Additionally, I wanted to provide our users the ability to input credit card information as quickly and easily as possible and I wanted to ensure that a receipt of the transaction would be sent after the transaction was successful.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="prj9_s3_info" class="slide_info">
                <p>Once it was decided that we would take Payments by Wave for iOS from Hackathon to production I:</p>
                <ul class="styled">
                  <li>Gathered feedback from co-workers</li>
                  <li>Improved the existing wireframes</li>
                  <li>Polished up the visual design</li>
                  <li>Created user stories for a beta build and beyond</li>
                  <li>Worked with the Payments back-end team to create additional APIs</li>
                  <li>Recruited and surveyed potential beta participants</li>
                  <li>Collected feedback from 60 beta participants</li>
                  <li>Definied measurable goals for the app after launch</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div id="prj9_s4_info" class="slide_info">
                <p>From the feedback, I wanted to determine how new and existing Wave users would use the app. I wanted to know which features worked, which didn't, what functionality was unnecessary and what was missing. I was looking at the beta as an MVP to tell us what our users actually wanted and what would enable them to get paid faster.</p>
              </div>
              <div id="prj9_s5_info" class="slide_info">
                <p>In addition to user feedback, I've determined a number of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that we'll monitor via our in-house setup, <a href="http://mixpanel.com" target="_blank">Mixpanel</a>, and <a href="http://leanplum.com" target="_blank">Leanplum</a>. These metrics will help inform us which areas of the app need improvement, which need to be removed and if we're meeting & exceeding our goals.</p>
                <p>We'll watch things like DAU (Daily Active Users) & DAU/MAU (Daily Active Users/Monthly Active Users) to determine stickiness and retention. We'll also closely watch downloads, payments volume, sign ups and the LTV (Life Time Value) of the users we're acquiring.</p>
